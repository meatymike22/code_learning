# GRE math tips:

## picking numbers for comparison:
### pick extremes
  * pick the lowest number possible, and then a number much bigger than that
  * dont pick numbers right next to eachother unless the question asks for it

## percentage:
* a as a percentage of b is a/b x 100

## Triangles:

### Each side of a triangle **MUST** be:
* less than the sum of the other two sides
* greater than the difference between the other two sides

### Shapes with 3+ sides:

#### Each side MUST be:
* less than the sum of all sides

## Combinations:

**(n!)/((n-r)!r!)**

* n = total from which we are picking out of the group or biggest number
* r = size of group being picked out/selecting from total or smaller number

*tip to remember*: terms on the bottom will always add up to the term at the top

**different from permutations**: permutations are for when the _order_ matters

### Good question:
* There are 6 women and 5 men. We want to select 2 women and 2 men. How many ways are there
of selecting 2 women AND 2 men from the people available?

  * AND = multiple
  * OR = add

  * 6!/(4!2!) = 15
  * 5!/(3!2!) = 10
  * 15*10 = 150

## Probability:

### Example:
* 3 red beads, 5 green beads. If 2 beads are picked at random AND without replacement, 
1. Prob of picking 2 greens? 2. Prob of picking 2 same colors? 2 diff colors?

  * AND = multiple
  * OR = add

  1. green and green = 5/8 X 4/7 = 5/14
  2. Red and red OR green and green = 5/8 X 4/7 + 3/8 X 2/7 = 13/28
  3. red and green OR green and red = 3/8 X 5/7 + 5/8 X 3/7 = 15/28

## Median:

* Median = middle term of a set of _ascending order sorted list_ of numbers
* mean = average
* if even set of numbers, take 2 medians and divide by 2

### What is the median of all the positive integers less than 75?
* (Biggest + smallest)/2
*For any consecutive list, median = mean*

### Median of Incomes of 25 people

| Income Range | Frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| $0-$20k      | 6         |
| $20k-$40k    | 7         |
| $40k-$60k    | 7         |
| $60k-$100k   | 4         |
| $100k+       | 1         |

#### Median salary in what range?

* (num+1)/2 = 13
* 13th person is in $20k-$40k range
